## Last Week's Accomplishments

Did some more refactoring, and ran everything through an autoformatter.
Not very interesting but now the code scores 6.8/10 on Pylint. Up from -12.

## This Week's Plan

I am going to go through the usual steps of using Carme as a normal user, and see what needs work.

## Anything Blocking?

A new Git module would be helpful. But nothing major blocking.

## Notes

We might be able to remove some bad code which would be great!
