- Work with Alex to enable Travis builds on `rpi-validator`: https://github.com/rcos/rpi-validator/issues/4
- Develop an engineering plan for the "Fast-Forward" system
    - This was a lot more work than it sounds like. There wasn't a clear engineering solution before a set of length engineering sessions.
    - We do have notes from these meetings.
- Clarify roles within teams
- Decide on AWS Lambda for hosting content
- Create GitHub repository for a servless function that returns a list of projects https://github.com/codingandcommunity/booster-read-projects-function
