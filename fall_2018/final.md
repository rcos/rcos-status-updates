# Final

So this semester has been a bit difficult for Carme, both because of and
despite all our members.

Personally I spent much of the semester trying to get the Docker Python SDK
to cooporate. The more I worked on it the more I realized that Docker seems
to be very Go centric. Actually many times I thought that the project would
be much better if we ditched our mediocre Python code and rewrote in Go.

Eventually I gave up on the SDK. I think Docker simply provides it as a token
gesture, and doesn't actually support and maintain it.

Overall Carme seems to lack direction as a project. We keep adding new features
without having a functional core, and no one wants to work on the core because
it is non-functional.

And while I have tried my best over the semester to fix this, the project just
keeps getting pulled in different directions by all it's memebers.

In the end I think Carme has real merit as a project, but needs to work on it's
core vision and goals.
