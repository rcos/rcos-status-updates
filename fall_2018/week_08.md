## Last Week's Accomplishments
After fighting with the Python Docker SDK for over a month to try and get it to
work the way I want to I have finally given up on it. Simply put the Python SDK
for Docker is bad, it is clear that most of the Docker ecosystem is built
around Go.

## This Week's Plan
Since I can cut out the Docker SDK now is a great time to fix some of our
dependency issues.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing anymore.

## Notes
Have a busy week, so I might not get a ton done.
