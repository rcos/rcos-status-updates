## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I did some pair-programming with Aaron Shapiro on some front-end boiler plate using React. I also worked briefly on the universal entity library with Dylan.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan on working more on the entity library and some other backend functionality if I get to it.

## Anything Blocking?

Need to learn more about MobX if I am going to work on frontend.
