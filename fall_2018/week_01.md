Last week I learned a little bit more about the plan for our project during the small group meeting. I was assigned to the backend team and so I will be contributing to the project in that respect. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

I plan to do research about github, Mongo DB, flask, and web architechture in an effort to understand my role as someone contributing to the backend of our project. I hope to familiarize myself a bit with github to complete the status request and for the future when we have changes we want to make to our project. I completed GitHub's tutorial by creating a repository named Hello-world and editing the README in preparation for submitting this status update.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

I have no experience or previous exposure to the technology we will be working with so I will be doing a lot of research to become informed.
