## Last Week's Accomplishments

Not too much. Career Fair kept everyone busy.

## This Week's Plan

Work on refactoring the current code and fixing all linting issues.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing yet, but we will probably hit something.

## Notes

Might setup a CI system this week as well but this is pending some group discussions.
