## Last Week's Accomplishments
  Last week I created ports for the Catan AI project. This is an important game function in which you can trade resources for other resources at these
  ports. 
## This Week's Plan
  This week I want to implement the "Longest Road" feature in Catan. The "longest road" involves a connection between 5 roads or more for a player
  if no one has the longest road. If multiple people have greater than 5 roads, then the person with the longest connection achieves the longest
  road. 
## Anything Blocking?
  Nothing blocking at the moment. The only challenge I will have to face involves thinking about the logic necessary to test for the longest road.
  There are many corner cases that I have to consider for what's considered the "longest road in catan", since there are several different 
  setups for what's considered a long road.
