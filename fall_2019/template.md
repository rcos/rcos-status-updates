## Last Week's Accomplishments
This past week I figured out what was causing the errors in my unit tests. Certain models took a field as their primary key, 
and I wasn't specifying that field so many-to-many relationships couldn't be used. I also learned the importance of saving 
objects in Django and when it is necessary to do so. As I finished writing the unit tests, I also realized some fixes that 
could be applied to the petitions model itself and created an issue for that. I also talked with my mentor about whether or 
not to keep setter and getter functions in the model, and we both decided that while they aren't necessary, we would leave 
the functions in for now.

## This Week's Plan
This week I plan to finish up writing the unit tests (only about one more to go!) Afterwards I would like to start working 
on the fixes in the petitions model that I noticed and start looking into admin functionalities.

## Anything Blocking?
It was difficult to adapt to familiarize with the code and understand where and what every function did. I was also 
difficult to code in typescript because even though I have worked with JavaScript before it was a while ago so I was 
very rusty and I there are certain key differences that make it confusing convert from JavaScript to typescript. 
Thankfully our team leader has been quite helpful with that. I also had a late start to the class due to a 
scheduling conflict which made it a little difficult to jump in at the beginning but it is much better now.
